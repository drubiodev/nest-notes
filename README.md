# Nest Notes

## Project Overview

As an intern at Digital Nest, I want a mobile-first note taking app to efficiently record and manage my work and learnings during my internship.

The app should provide the following features:

1. Create Note: As an intern, I want to be able to create new notes easily, to document my tasks, ideas, and learnings.

2. Update Note: As an intern, I want the ability to edit and update my existing notes to keep them relevant and accurate as my work progresses.

3. Delete Note: As an intern, I want the option to delete notes that are no longer needed.

4. Store Notes Locally: As an intern, I want the app to store my notes locally on my device to ensure accessibility and privacy without requiring an internet connection.

5. (Optional): Although not an immediate requirement, it would be beneficial to have the ability to search through my notes to quickly find relevant information or references as needed.

```

2. Initializing a new Git repo

```bash
cd /path/to/your/code
git init
```

3. Cread a README.md file

- in the root of your project, create a new file called `README.md`
- add some content to the file

```markdown

git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

5. If you have a git repo push your changes.

### Debuging

#### JavaScript

- Use `console.log()` to print values to the console for debugging purposes.

```javascript
console.log("Note created successfully!");
```

- Use `debugger` to pause the execution of your code and inspect the current state.

```javascript
const appName = "Nest Notes";

debugger;
```

- Navigate to the "Console" tab to view logs and errors.

#### VS Code Debugger

- Use the VS Code Debugger to set breakpoints and step through your code.

- Open the VS Code Debugger by clicking on the "Run and Debug" icon in the sidebar or pressing `F5`.

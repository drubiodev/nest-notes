# Nest Notes

## Project Overview

As an intern at Digital Nest, I want a mobile-first note taking app to efficiently record and manage my work and learnings during my internship.

The app should provide the following features:

1. Create Note: As an intern, I want to be able to create new notes easily, to document my tasks, ideas, and learnings.

2. Update Note: As an intern, I want the ability to edit and update my existing notes to keep them relevant and accurate as my work progresses.

3. Delete Note: As an intern, I want the option to delete notes that are no longer needed.

4. Store Notes Locally: As an intern, I want the app to store my notes locally on my device to ensure accessibility and privacy without requiring an internet connection.

5. (Optional): Although not an immediate requirement, it would be beneficial to have the ability to search through my notes to quickly find relevant information or references as needed.

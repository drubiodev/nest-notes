- `var` is like a box that you can take anywhere. But sometimes, it can be a bit confusing because you might accidentally use the box for different things.

- `let` is like a box that you can only take inside specific places. It’s like a little fenced-off section. You can’t take it out of that area, so it’s easier to keep track of. If you try to use box outside that area, you wouldnt be albe to.

- `const` similar to let but once you choose it, you can’t change it. It stays exactly the same forever! It’s like having a favorite box that you never want to replace.
